<p>b. STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION:</p>
 
 
<p>1. General:</p>
 
 
<p>a) The appropriations made in this act to state institutions 
 of higher education within the Items for student financial assistance may be 
 expended for any one, all, or any combination of the following purposes: grants 
 to undergraduate students enrolled at least one-half time in a degree, 
 certificate, industry-based certification and related programs that do not 
 qualify for other sources of student financial assistance or diploma program; 
 grants to full-time graduate students; graduate assistantships: grants to 
 students enrolled full-time in a dual or concurrent undergraduate and graduate 
 program. The institutions may also use these appropriations for the purpose of 
 supporting work study programs. The institution is required to transfer to 
 educational and general appropriations all funds used for work study or to pay 
 graduate assistantships. Institutions may also contribute to federal or private 
 student grant aid programs requiring matching funds by the institution, except 
 for programs requiring work. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia 
 shall annually review each institution's plan for the expenditures of its 
 general fund appropriation for undergraduate student financial assistance prior 
 to the start of the fall term to determine program compliance. The 
 institution's plan shall include the institution's assumptions and calculations 
 for determining the cost of attendance, student financial need, and student 
 remaining need as well as an award schedule or description of how funds are 
 awarded. For the purposes of the proposed plan, each community college shall be 
 considered independently. No limitations shall be placed on the awarding of 
 nongeneral fund appropriations made in this act to state institutions of higher 
 education within the Items for student financial assistance other than those 
 found previously in this paragraph and as follows: (i) funds derived from in-state 
 student tuition will not subsidize out-of-state students, (ii) students 
 receiving these funds must be making satisfactory academic progress, (iii) 
 awards made to students should be based primarily on financial need, and (iv) 
 institutions should make larger grant and scholarship awards to students taking 
 the number of credit hours necessary to complete a degree in a timely manner. </p>
 
 
<p>b) All awards made to undergraduate students from such Items 
 shall be for Virginia students only and such awards shall offset all, or 
 portions of, the costs of tuition and required fees, and, in the case of 
 students qualifying under subdivision b 2 c)1) hereof, the cost of books. All 
 undergraduate financial aid award amounts funded by this appropriation shall be 
 proportionate to the remaining need of individual students, with students with 
 higher levels of remaining need receiving grants before other students. No 
 criteria other than the need of the student shall be used to determine the 
 award amount. Because of the low cost of attendance and recognizing that 
 federal grants provide a much higher portion of cost than at other 
 institutions, a modified approach and minimum award amount for the neediest 
 VGAP student should be implemented for community college and Richard Bland College 
 students based on remaining need and the combination of federal and grant state 
 aid. Student financial need shall be determined by a need-analysis system 
 approved by the Council.</p>
 
 
<p>c)1) All need-based awards made to graduate students shall be 
 determined by the use of a need-analysis system approved by the Council.</p>
 
 
<p>2) As part of the six-year financial plans required in the 
 provisions of Chapters 933 and 945 of the 2005 Acts of Assembly, each 
 institution of higher education shall report the extent to which tuition and 
 fee revenues are used to support graduate student aid and graduate compensation 
 and how the use of these funds impacts planned increases in student tuition and 
 fees.</p>
 
 
<p>d) A student who receives a grant under such Items and who, 
 during a semester, withdraws from the institution which 
 made the award must surrender the unearned portion. The institution shall 
 calculate the unearned portion of the award based on the percentage used for 
 federal Return to Title IV program purposes.</p>
 
 
<p>e) An award made under such Items to assist a student in 
 attending an institution's summer session shall be prorated according to the 
 size of comparable awards made in that institution's regular session. </p>
 
 
<p>f) The provisions of this act under the heading "Student 
 Financial Assistance for Higher Education" shall not apply to (1) the soil 
 scientist scholarships authorized under &sect;<a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/23.1-615">23.1-615</a>, Code of Virginia and (2) 
 need-based financial aid programs for industry-based certification and related 
 programs that do not qualify for other sources of student financial assistance, 
 which will be subject to guidelines developed by the State Council of Higher 
 Education for Virginia.</p>
 
 
<p>g) Unless noted elsewhere in this act, general fund awards 
 shall be named "Commonwealth" grants.</p>
 
 
<p>h) Unless otherwise provided by statute, undergraduate awards 
 shall not be made to students seeking a second or additional baccalaureate 
 degree until the financial aid needs of first-degree seeking students are fully 
 met.</p>
 
 
<p>i) In determining financial need for student financial 
 assistance, the institution shall recognize the federal Student Aid Index at no 
 less than zero.</p>
 
 
<p>j) Students receiving student financial assistance in 
 <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2023-2024">2023-2024</a> may be considered for Virginia Student Financial Assistance Program 
 awards based on the Expected Family Contribution demonstrated in <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2023-2024">2023-2024</a>, or 
 appropriately adjusted need as determined by the institution, for as long as 
 the student maintains continuous enrollment, unless granted an exception for 
 cause by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, until current 
 degree completion or current degree program eligibility limits have otherwise 
 expired, whichever comes first.</p>
 
 
<p>k) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, 
 the Student Aid Index as calculated according to federal Title IV financial aid 
 methodology shall be deemed an approved replacement of any mention or use of 
 the precedent federal Expected Family Contribution for purposes of 
 administrating state higher education financial aid programs.</p>
 
 
<p>l) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, 
 private institutions admitted on or after January 1, 2024 in any state program 
 of higher education financial assistance shall (i) be a nonprofit private 
 institution of higher education whose primary purpose is to provide collegiate, 
 graduate, or professional education and not to provide religious training or 
 theological education; (ii) be formed, chartered, established, or incorporated 
 within the Commonwealth; (iii) have their principal place of business within 
 the Commonwealth; (iv) conduct their primary educational activity within the 
 Commonwealth; and (v) be accredited by a nationally recognized regional 
 institutional accrediting agency.</p>
 
 
<p>2. Grants To Undergraduate Students:</p>
 
 
<p>a) Each institution which makes undergraduate 
 grants paid from its appropriation for student financial assistance shall 
 expend such sums as approved for that purpose by the Council.</p>
 
 
<p>b) A student receiving an award must be duly admitted and 
 enrolled in a degree, certificate or diploma program at the institution making 
 the award, and shall be making satisfactory 
 academic progress as defined by the institution for the purposes of eligibility 
 under Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act, as amended.</p>
 
 
<p>c)1) It is the intent of the General Assembly that students 
 eligible under the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (VGAP) authorized in 
 Title 23.1, Chapter 4.4:2, Code of Virginia, shall receive grants before all 
 other students at the same institution with equivalent remaining need from the 
 appropriations for undergraduate student financial assistance found in Part 1 
 of this act (service area 1081000 - Scholarships). In each instance, VGAP 
 eligible students shall receive awards greater than other students with 
 equivalent remaining need.</p>
 
 
<p>2) The amount of each VGAP grant shall vary according to each 
 student's remaining need and the total of tuition, all required fees and the 
 cost of books at the institution the student will attend upon acceptance for 
 admission. The actual amount of the VGAP award will be determined by the 
 proportionate award schedule adopted by each institution; however, those 
 students with the greatest financial need shall be guaranteed an award at least 
 equal to tuition.</p>
 
 
<p>3) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Virginia 
 Guaranteed Assistance Program serve as an incentive to financially needy 
 students now attending elementary and secondary school in Virginia to raise 
 their expectations and their academic performance and to consider higher 
 education an achievable objective in their futures.</p>
 
 
<p>4) Students may not receive a VGAP and a Commonwealth grant in 
 the same semester.</p>
 
 
<p>d) Of the amount allocated for undergraduate need-based 
 financial aid, up to one percent may be used for emergency assistance programs 
 for students facing a financial emergency that puts them at risk of dropping 
 out. The Council shall establish reporting guidelines and approve criteria for 
 making student awards.</p>
 
 
<p>3. Grants To Graduate Students:</p>
 
 
<p>a) An individual award may be based on financial need but may, 
 in addition to or instead of, be based on other criteria determined by the 
 institution making the award. The amount of an award shall be determined by the 
 institution making the award; however, the Council shall annually be notified 
 as to the maximum size of a graduate award that is paid from funds in the 
 appropriation.</p>
 
 
<p>b) A student receiving a graduate award paid from the 
 appropriation must be duly admitted into a graduate degree program at the 
 institution making the award.</p>
 
 
<p>c) Not more than 50 percent of the funds designated by an 
 institution as graduate grants from the appropriation, and approved as such by 
 the Council, shall be awarded to persons not eligible to be classified as 
 Virginia domiciliary resident students except in cases where the persons meet 
 the criteria outlined in &sect;4-2.01b.6.</p>
 
 
<p>4. Matching Funds: Any institution of higher education may, 
 with the approval of the Council, use funds from its appropriation for 
 fellowships and scholarships to provide the institutional contribution to any 
 student financial aid program established by the federal government or private 
 sources which requires the matching of the 
 contribution by institutional funds, except for programs requiring work.</p>
 
 
<p>5. Discontinued Loan Program:</p>
 
 
<p>a) If any federal student loan program for which the 
 institutional contribution was appropriated by the General Assembly is 
 discontinued, the institutional share of the discontinued loan program shall be 
 repaid to the fund from which the institutional share was derived unless other 
 arrangements for the use of the funds are recommended by the Council and 
 approved by the Department of Planning and Budget. Should the institution be 
 permitted to retain the federal contributions to the program, the funds shall 
 be used according to arrangements authorized by the Council and approved by the 
 Department of Planning and Budget.</p>
 
 
<p>b)1) An institution of higher education may discontinue its 
 student loan fund established pursuant to Title 23.1, Chapter 4.01, Code of 
 Virginia. The full amount of cash in such discontinued loan fund shall be paid 
 into the state treasury into a nonrevertible nongeneral fund account. Prior to 
 such payment, the State Comptroller shall verify its accuracy, including the 
 fact that the cash held by the institution in the loan fund will be fully 
 depleted by such payment. The loan fund shall not be reestablished thereafter 
 for that institution.</p>
 
 
<p>2) The cash so paid into the state treasury shall be used only 
 for grants to undergraduate and graduate students in the Higher Education 
 Student Financial Assistance program according to arrangements authorized by 
 the Council and approved by the Department of Planning and Budget.</p>
 
 
<p>3) Payments on principal and interest of any promissory notes 
 held by the discontinued loan fund shall continue to be received by the 
 institution, which shall deposit such payments in the state treasury to the 
 nonrevertible nongeneral fund account specified in subdivision (1) preceding, 
 to be used for grants as specified in subdivision (2) preceding.</p>
 
 
<p>6. Reporting: The Council shall collect student-specific 
 information for undergraduate students as is necessary for the operation of the 
 Student Financial Assistance Program. The Council shall maintain regulations 
 governing the operation of the Student Financial Assistance Program based on 
 the provisions outlined in this section, the Code of Virginia, and State 
 Council policy.</p>
